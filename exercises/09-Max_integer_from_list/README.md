1. Write a script that finds the biggest integer in my_list
 and print that number in the console with the print() function.

💡Hint:
- Define an auxiliar variable and set the first value to 0.
- then compare the variables with all the items in the list.
- Replace the value every time the new element is bigger than the one stored in the auxiliar variable.
- At the end you will have the biggest number stored in the variable.
