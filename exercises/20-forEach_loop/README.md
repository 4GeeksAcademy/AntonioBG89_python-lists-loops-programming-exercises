# `20`
It is possible to traverse an list using the list.forEach function.
You have to specify what to do on each iteration of the loop.
```js
//item will be the value of the specific item.
//index will be the item index.
//arr will be the
my_list.forEach(function(item, index, arr){

});
```

# 📝Instructions
Right now, the code is printing all the items in the list:
 1. Please change the function code to print only the numbers `divisible by 14`.

💡HINT
`A number X is divisible by 2 if: (X%2===0)`
