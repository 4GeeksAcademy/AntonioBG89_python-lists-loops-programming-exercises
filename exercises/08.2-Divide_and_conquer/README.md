# `08.2` Divide and conquer

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function called `sort_odd_even` that expects a list of numbers (integers).

2. Loop through the list and separate the `odd` and the `even` numbers in different lists.

3. If the number is odd, push it to a placeholder list named `odd`.

4. If the number is even, push it to a placeholder list named `even`.

5. Then insert the `odd` list and the `even` list into another NEW list. Remember, the `odd` list comes first, and you have to append the `even` after.

## 💡 Hint:

+ Create empty (placeholder) variables when you need to store data.

## 💻 Expected result:

```py
sort_odd_even([1,2,33,10,20,4])

[[1,33,2], [10,20,4]]
```
