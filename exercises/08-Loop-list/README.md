# `08` Instructions from your teacher:

The code right now is `printing the first item in the console.` Instead of doing that, print `all the elements` in the list.
```js
You will have to loop through the whole array using a for loop.
```

ðŸ’¡HINT
1. Remember that to access the value of a position you have to use the index
2. print(my_list[index]);

Expected console result:
