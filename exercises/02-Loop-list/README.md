# `02` Loop list

# 📝Instructions from your teacher:
1. The code right now is printing the first item in the console.
2. Instead of doing that, print `all the elements` in the list.
```py
You will have to loop through the whole array using a for loop.
```

💡HINT
1. Remember that to access the value of a position you have to use the index
2. print(my_list[index]);

Expected console result:
```py
