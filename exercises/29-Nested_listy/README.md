Instructions from your teacher:
# `29` Nested list
It is possible to find an list comprised of other lists (it is called a two-dimension list or matrix).

In this example, we have a list of coordinates that you can access by doing the following:

//longitude = []
// for loop in coordinate longitude
longitude = coordinatesArray[0][1];


Instructions:
Loop through the array printing only the longitudes.

The result should be something like this:
-112.633853
-63.987
-81.901693
-71.653268
