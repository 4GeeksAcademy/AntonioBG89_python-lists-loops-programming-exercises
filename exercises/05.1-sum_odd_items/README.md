# `19`
# 📝Instructions from your teacher:

1. Create a function called sumOdds that sums all the odd numbers in the "arr"
2. list and returns the result.

# To do this exercise consider:
- You have to `loop the list`.
- You will need to `declare an auxiliar variable outside the loop` to keep adding the values.
- On each loop, you have to `ask if the value of the list in that index position is an odd number`.
- If its odd then add the value to the `auxiliar`.

💡Hint: an auxiliar variable is a regular variable, the only difference is a logical difference; an
auxiliar variable is like a chosen one, it'll be useful until it completes its purpose (add all the values,
make a copy of a value, etc).
