# `03` Access and retirve

# 📝Instructions from your teacher:

Lists are part of every programming language. They are the way to go when you want to have a "list of elements."

For example, we could have an array that is storing the days of the week:
```js
my_list = ['sunday','monday','tuesday','wednesday','thursday','friday','saturday'];
```

![What is an list?](http://i.imgur.com/DbmSOHT.png)

Every list has the following parts:
- `Items:` are the actual values inside on each position of the list.
- `Length:` is the size of the list, the number of items.
- `Index:` is the position of an element.
```py
To access any particular item within the array you need to know its index (position).
The index is an integer value that represents the position in which the element is located.
Protip: Every array starts from cero (0)!
```

## 📝 Instructions

1. Using the print() function, print the 3rd item from the list.
2. Change the value in the position where 'Thursday' is located to None.
3. Print the particular position of the step two.
