# `02.6` Letter counter

# 📝Instructions

Completely real definitely not-made-up background: Our customer needs a program that counts the letters repetitions in a given string,
I know sounds weird, but they are very adamant and need this asap!

1. Count the letters in the string used in "par" and print the number of times it is repeated throughout the string.
2. Capitalization should not affect the count (ie if there is a string that contains a capital "A" as well as a lowercase "a" the count for a should be 2).
3. Spaces should be ignored!

```py
Example
print(count())

//will print on the console { h: 1, e: 1, l: 2, o: 1 }
```
