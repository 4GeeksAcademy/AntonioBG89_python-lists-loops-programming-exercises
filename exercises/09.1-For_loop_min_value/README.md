# `09.1` Minimum Integer

It is possible to traverse a list using the `for` loop, and you have to specify what to do on each iteration of the loop.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please use the `for` loop function to get the minimum value from the list and print it in the console.

## 💡 Hints:

+ Declare an auxiliary global variable.

+ Set its value to a very big integer.

+ Every time you loop, compare its value to the item's value. If the item's value is smaller, update the auxiliary variable value to the item's value.

+ Outside the loop, after the loop is finished, print the auxiliary value.

## 💻 Expected result:

```py
23
```
