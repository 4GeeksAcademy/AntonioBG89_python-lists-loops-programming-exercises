# `28` Find average

Another way to loop a list with the for loop will be using the IN statement like this:

```py
for  index in my_list:
    print(myArray[index])
```


# 📝Instructions
Calculate the average value of all the items in the array and print it on the console.

# 💡HINT:
To print the average, you have to add all the values and divide the result by the total length of the array.
