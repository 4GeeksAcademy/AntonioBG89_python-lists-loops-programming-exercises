# `05` Instructions from your teacher:

You will never know how many `items` myStupidArray has because it is being `randomly` generated during runtime.

You know that the property
```js
SOMEARRAY.length
```

returns the `length of` SOMEARRAY.

## 📝 Instructions

1. Create a variable named theLastOne, and assign it the LAST element of myStupidArray.
2. Then, print it on the console.
