# `05` Instructions from your teacher:

You will never know how many `items` my_stupid_list has because it is being `randomly` generated during runtime.

You know that the property:
```js
len(name_list) function
```

returns the `length of` name_list .

## 📝 Instructions
1. Create a variable named the_last_one, and assign it the LAST element of my_stupid_list.
2. Then, print it on the console.

💡Hint:
`Remember import random function`
